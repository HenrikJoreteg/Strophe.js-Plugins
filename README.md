#Our little collection of Strophe.js plugins

## Intro
This collection will grow. We'll gradually clean this up and add more of our plugins as we find time.

## Goals
1. Completely abstract the XML and turn incoming XMPP stanzas into jQuery custom events that are triggered on the document. You can read more about jQuery events here: [triggering](http://api.jquery.com/trigger/), [binding](http://api.jquery.com/bind/), and [namespaced events](http://docs.jquery.com/Namespaced_Events).

2. Make XMPP easy to consume.

3. Give back.

## This is just a start... there will be more...
